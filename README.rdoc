Ever wanted to map your interface to an ip?

If you haven't, why not?

Alas, Macmap is here to help!

Usage is easy:

  Macmap.map_iface_to_ip %{ifconfig -a}

Or
  
  require "rubygems"
  require "popen3"
  
  Open3.popen3('ifconfig -a') { |stdin, stdout, stderr| Macmap.map_iface_to_ip(stdout) }  

Try it! It's fun
